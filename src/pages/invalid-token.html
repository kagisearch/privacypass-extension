    <p>
        You send an invalid Privacy Pass token.
    </p>
    <p>
        This may be for a few reasons, such as:
    <ul>
        <li>You have not used the extension in a while, and we failed to detect this and make you generate more tokens.
        </li>
        <li>You are or were debugging the extension against the staging environment, and have mixed tokens up.</li>
    </ul>
    In either case, to keep using Privacy Pass, open the extension settings, and click "Clear state". Then generate new
    tokens.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can continuing searching Kagi.com by disabling Privacy Pass mode.
